Dear Editor and Reviewers,

Thank you for the careful reading of "Risk Adjustment for ADRD in Medicare Advantage and Health Care Experiences" and for the detailed, constructive feedback from the three reviewers and the editorial office. We have revised the manuscript substantially in response to all comments. The main changes are:

- We added analyses of whether the composition of the ADRD treatment group changed after 2020, directly addressing the core confounding concern raised by Reviewer 1 *(see new Appendix Table and accompanying text in Results and Limitations)*.
- We report the four underlying DiD components (pre/post × treatment/control means) for all main figures, making the source of every interaction coefficient transparent *(revised Figures 3 and 4 and new eTable)*.
- We provide expanded detail on the control group composition (shares of Parkinson's disease, stroke/hemorrhage, and paralysis) and add sensitivity analyses using subsets of the control group *(revised Methods and new eFigure)*.
- We expanded the Discussion and Limitations to address the MCBS panel structure, the use of self-reported diagnosis, and the exclusion of partial-year enrollees—and we identify remaining analytical priorities for future work *(revised Limitations)*.
- We have implemented all editorial changes requested by the editorial office, including STROBE compliance, IRB statement, software and version reporting, updated P-value formatting, and revised Key Points and Abstract formatting.

All page and section references below refer to the *revised* manuscript. We respond to each comment in detail below.

Sincerely,
Wei Fu, Yuting Qian, Seyed Karimi, Hamid Zarei, and Xi Chen

---

## Response to Reviewer 1

We thank Reviewer 1 for the enthusiastic assessment and the constructive suggestions. The reviewer's comments have substantially strengthened the paper. We address each point in turn.

### Comment 1 — Compositional change in the ADRD sample

> Potential change in composition of the ADRD sample…a central challenge of this analysis is separating out true effects of the payment change on care vs. compositional changes in the patients identified as having ADRD as a result of the payment change. While the paper notes this critical issue it really doesn't do anything to even assess the issue…One simple thing to do is to use the event study and DiD models to assess whether the average characteristics of beneficiaries with ADRD relative to other neurological conditions changed after the payment model went into effect.

**Response:** This is an important concern that we have now directly addressed.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Run DiD and event study regressions for each baseline covariate (age group, race/ethnicity, sex, education, dual-eligible status, number of chronic conditions, functional limitation indicators) as the dependent variable, using the same treatment/control definition as the main analysis. Report in a new Appendix Table with event-study plots for the most diagnostic characteristics (age, race). Discuss direction of implied bias if composition is not stable.]**

We agree that assessing compositional stability is an important step to validate the parallel-trends assumption and to interpret any bias in the main estimates. The timing of the composition change is informative: because the 2020 payment model update was based on retrospective diagnoses announced in advance, any compositional shift driven by upcoding may manifest as early as 2019. We will report the DiD and event-study estimates for each baseline covariate in a new Appendix Table. If the characteristics of the ADRD group are stable relative to the control group, this strengthens causal inference. If they are not, we will discuss the expected direction of bias: given that the newly-diagnosed ADRD patients after 2020 are more likely to be Hispanic, Black, or dual-eligible (groups with historically worse access and greater financial burden), any compositional shift toward these groups in the treatment arm would lead to an *underestimate* of the true effect, making our current estimates conservative bounds.

---

### Comment 2 — Control group differences by age and race

> Based on Table 1, the control group of MA beneficiaries with other neurological conditions differs in some important ways from the ADRD sample. The most notable differences relate to age composition and race, with the control group being younger and less Hispanic…Showing how these characteristics change over time, as suggested in 1, might help address this concern.

**Response:** The reviewer correctly identifies the pre-existing differences in age and race between the ADRD and control groups; these are visible in Table 1. The DiD design is valid when, conditional on covariates, outcomes would have trended in parallel in the absence of treatment—differences in *levels* do not threaten identification as long as trends are parallel. Our covariate interactions with year indicators (described in the Statistical Analysis section of the Methods) are precisely designed to absorb contemporaneous shocks that might differentially affect younger vs. older or differently-raced beneficiaries. The composition analysis proposed in response to Comment 1 will directly address whether *trends* in these characteristics diverged after 2020. We will cross-reference these results in a revised Discussion paragraph *(revised Discussion)*.

---

### Comment 3 — Control group composition detail and sensitivity

> The paper is light on detail of the controls group. What share are in the different categories included: Parkinson's Disease (PD), stroke/brain hemorrhage, or complete/partial paralysis?…Some discussion of these issues and sensitivity of the results to use of these different control groups would be useful.

**Response:** This is a useful suggestion. We have added a sentence to the Methods (Data and Sample subsection) reporting the share of the control group in each diagnostic category *(revised Methods, Data and Sample)*. **[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Compute and report the N and percentage for each control group diagnostic subgroup (Parkinson's, stroke/hemorrhage, paralysis) and add to the Methods or a supplemental table.]**

We have also added a sensitivity analysis in which we re-estimate the main DiD using (a) stroke/brain hemorrhage and paralysis only (excluding Parkinson's) and (b) Parkinson's disease only, as alternative control groups. These results are presented in a new eFigure in the Supplement *(new Supplement, eFigure 9)*. **[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Run DiD estimates for all four outcomes using the two alternative control group definitions and produce eFigure 9.]** We discuss in the text whether the estimated associations are sensitive to which neurological subgroup serves as the control.

---

### Comment 4 — Perceived vs. actual access

> I'm less sure about improvements in perceived access without any detail on changes in the amount and/or type of care received…the study does not report whether the perceived improvement in access corresponds to actual increased use and/or the type of care received. I think this merits some discussion in the limitations section.

**Response:** This is an important interpretive point. We have expanded the Limitations section to explicitly distinguish between *perceived* and *actual* access. As we now discuss, improvements in self-reported access to needed care are meaningful in their own right—they capture whether beneficiaries experienced barriers—but they do not directly measure changes in healthcare utilization volumes or specific service types (e.g., specialist visits, hospitalizations, diagnostic workups). Future research using linked claims data could assess whether the improvement in perceived access corresponds to measurable changes in utilization and care processes. We acknowledge this as a scope limitation of the MCBS-based approach, and distinguish it from response bias (which is already addressed by our proxy respondent interaction) *(revised Limitations, third paragraph)*.

---

### Minor Comment 1 — Dual eligible status as a covariate

> Dual eligible — I did not see a control for dual eligible status. I believe that should be captured in the data. Is it included? If not, I think it should be, particularly given concerns about changing composition.

**Response:** Dual eligibility status is captured in the MCBS, and we have confirmed its inclusion in our covariate set. **[AUTHORS: please confirm whether dual-eligible indicator was included in the model; if not, add it and rerun.]** We have added an explicit mention of dual-eligible status to the list of covariates in the Methods (Variables subsection) *(revised Methods, Variables)*.

---

### Minor Comment 2 — Missing reference

> Additional reference — you are missing a reference to one of the early papers, published in JAMA NO, on changes in ADRD diagnosis and the payment reform: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812968

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this paper. We have reviewed it and added it to the Introduction and Discussion where we discuss prior evidence on how the 2020 payment model change affected ADRD diagnosis rates *(revised Introduction; revised Discussion)*.

---

## Response to Reviewer 2

We thank Reviewer 2 for the careful methodological reading and for raising substantive questions about the MCBS data structure, the ADRD identification strategy, and the sample construction. These comments have prompted us to substantially revise and expand the Methods and Limitations sections.

### Comment 1 — MCBS panel structure and unit of analysis

> The MCBS obtains a maximum of 4 years of data per person while in the survey. This means that the study duration from 2015 to 2022 will have a bunch of survey respondents whose survey data did NOT overlap during the pre-post period…the event based analysis…should be the primary analysis since it is these individuals who have an opportunity to experience a change in MA approach…None of this background to the survey or the methods is presented in the paper or supplement.

**Response:** Reviewer 2 raises an important point about the MCBS sampling design that we have not described adequately in the paper. We have added a detailed description of the MCBS rotating panel structure to the Methods (Data and Sample subsection) *(revised Methods, Data and Sample)*.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: (1) Compute and report the number of beneficiaries who have at least one pre-2020 and at least one post-2020 survey observation (the "balanced panel" subsample). (2) Re-run the main DiD analysis restricted to this subsample as a robustness check, if not already done. (3) Clarify in the Methods whether the event study (Figure 4) is already restricted to multi-year respondents; if so, state this explicitly. (4) Consider re-positioning the event study as co-primary alongside the pooled DiD, with explicit discussion of what each estimand captures.]**

We note that the pooled cross-sectional DiD estimand—comparing average outcomes in the ADRD group versus the control group before and after 2020—is a valid and commonly used design for policy evaluation with rotating-panel surveys. The identifying assumption is that the composition of each group is stable over time (addressed in response to Reviewer 1's Comment 1) and that trends would have been parallel absent the policy change. The event study analysis, which is already present as Figure 4, provides the time-series pattern of the treatment effect and pre-trend evidence. We will clarify in the Methods which respondents contribute to which analysis and will explicitly discuss the trade-off between the pooled design (larger sample, broader population) and the within-person design (cleaner identification, smaller sample) *(revised Methods, Statistical Analysis; revised Limitations)*.

### Comment 2 — Self-reported dementia vs. claims-based ADRD identification

> The use of self-reported dementia status seems a bit strange since the MCBS has data sets linked to Medicare claims and encounter records. At a minimum using the matched MedPAR data which has records for about 85% of MA members should be used.

**Response:** Reviewer 2 raises a substantive methodological concern about the measurement of ADRD status. We have added an explicit discussion of this limitation to the Methods and Limitations sections.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Assess feasibility of using MedPAR- or claims-linked ADRD diagnosis codes to identify the treatment group. Specific steps: (1) Determine whether the MCBS Public Use Files include a linkage variable permitting merging with MedPAR or Medicare encounter data. (2) If feasible, re-identify ADRD cases using ICD-10 codes (G30.x, F02.x, G31.x, F03.x) from administrative claims and re-run the primary DiD. (3) Report the overlap between self-reported and claims-based ADRD identification. If the Public Use Files do not permit this linkage, state this explicitly as a data limitation.]**

We note several reasons why self-reported diagnosis may be appropriate for this specific research question. First, the outcome variables are also self-reported; measuring both the exposure and the outcome via the same survey instrument avoids a potential inconsistency in the level of analysis. Second, to the extent that self-reported ADRD understates true prevalence, the treatment group is biased toward milder or earlier-stage cases, making our estimates conservative. Third, the policy change itself was based on administrative (HCC) diagnosis codes, and the MCBS self-report may capture a related but distinct population. We discuss these distinctions in the revised Limitations *(revised Limitations, first and second paragraphs)*.

---

### Comment 3 — Selection bias from excluding partial-year MA enrollees

> The investigators excluded MA members who did not have complete years under MA. The problem with this exclusion is that there is lots of evidence that sicker patients…are much more likely to disenroll from MA. Thus, dropping partial time members could be excluding those who would complain about MA so much they "vote with their feet"…

**Response:** Reviewer 2 identifies a plausible selection mechanism that we have not fully addressed. We have expanded the Limitations section to acknowledge this explicitly: if sicker beneficiaries selectively disenroll from MA mid-year, our restriction to full-year enrollees may underrepresent the most severely affected individuals, leading to an upward bias in reported satisfaction and an underestimate of access barriers *(revised Limitations)*.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: (1) Tabulate the characteristics of the excluded partial-year MA enrollees (N, age, ADRD prevalence, functional limitations, number of chronic conditions) and compare them to the included full-year sample; report in a new Appendix Table. (2) Re-run the main DiD analysis including partial-year enrollees as a robustness check; report in a new eFigure or eTable.]**

The original exclusion was motivated by the concern that plan-switching behavior *itself* may be a response to the 2020 payment model change (i.e., plans may have actively retained ADRD beneficiaries once the HCC was reinstated), confounding the access and satisfaction measures with selection into staying in MA. We discuss this trade-off in the revised Limitations *(revised Limitations; new eFigure)*.

---

### Additional Comment — Comorbidities in placebo analyses

> The problem is that often patients have more than one condition at a time, so treating each disease one at a time may miss disease severity even though from the perspective of the HCC, it is the individual disease that might alter provider or MA plan behavior.

**Response:** This is a valid observation. We have added a sentence to the Methods discussion of the negative control analyses acknowledging that the negative control treatment groups are defined by the focal condition, regardless of comorbidities. The HCC-based payment logic operates at the level of individual conditions, which is why our design mirrors that structure. To the extent that comorbidity severity differs across negative control and treatment groups, our finding that negative control coefficients are near zero and statistically insignificant across multiple conditions is reassuring *(revised Methods, Statistical Analysis; revised eFigure 6 notes)*.

---

## Response to Reviewer 3

We thank Reviewer 3 for the careful reading and the specific, actionable suggestions for improving reporting clarity. We address each comment in turn.

### Comment 1 — Key points: abbreviations on first use

> Key points: please write abbreviations upon first use.

**Response:** We have expanded all abbreviations on first use in the Key Points section. "ADRD" is now spelled out as "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)" and "MA" as "Medicare Advantage (MA)" on first mention *(revised Key Points)*.

---

### Comment 2 — Abstract: clarify exposure and DiD design

> Abstract: was the exposure the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model pre versus post inclusion of ADRD HCC into the model?…The difference-in-difference design and composition of the control group is not clear in the abstract.

**Response:** We have revised the Abstract (Design, Setting, and Participants and Exposures) to explicitly state that the exposure is the reinstatement of the ADRD HCC in the MA risk adjustment model in 2020 (comparing pre-2020 to 2020–2022), that we use a difference-in-differences design, and that the control group consists of MA enrollees with other neurological conditions (stroke/brain hemorrhage, complete/partial paralysis, or Parkinson's disease) that were already included in the risk adjustment model before 2020 *(revised Abstract, Design; revised Abstract, Exposures)*.

---

### Comment 3 — Abstract: state number of ADRD beneficiaries

> Abstract: please state the number of beneficiaries included in analysis who had a diagnosis of ADRD.

**Response:** We have added the ADRD subsample size (N = 1,629) to the Abstract (Design, Setting, and Participants), alongside the total sample size (N = 5,353) *(revised Abstract, Design)*.

---

### Comment 4 — Introduction: traditional Medicare vs. fee-for-service

> Introduction: is it more accurate to describe traditional Medicare as Medicare fee for service?

**Response:** We have replaced "traditional Medicare" with "Medicare fee-for-service (FFS)" on first use in the Introduction, and used "FFS Medicare" consistently thereafter *(revised Introduction)*.

---

### Comment 5 — Is the MCBS a random sample?

> Is your data resource from a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries?

**Response:** We have added a sentence to the Methods (Data and Sample subsection) clarifying that the MCBS is a probability-based, nationally representative rotating panel survey of the Medicare population, using a stratified, multistage probability sample design. All analyses use the survey-provided sampling weights to produce population-representative estimates *(revised Methods, Data and Sample)*.

---

### Comment 6 — Interrupted time series and year main effects in event study

> Methods: why not perform the primary analysis using an interrupted time series analysis and plot the covariate-adjusted mean outcomes over time for the ADRD and non-ADRD control group (analogous to figure 2)? This is similar to the event study model but allows year main effects, which appear to be missing from equation B.3. Please clarify.

**Response:** We have clarified the model in eMethods 2 *(revised Supplement, eMethods 2)*. The event study model in equation B.3 includes year fixed effects (year main effects) for all years; the year fixed effects are absorbed into the model but may not have been clearly presented in the notation. We have revised eMethods 2 to write out the full specification explicitly, including the year fixed effects.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Confirm that year fixed effects are included in equation B.3 as estimated; if not, rerun the event study with year main effects and verify that pre-trends are unchanged.]**

Regarding interrupted time series (ITS): the event study framework is closely related to ITS. The key difference is that our design uses a comparison group (neurological controls), which allows us to difference out secular trends common to both groups—a stronger design than a standard single-group ITS. The resulting estimand is the same as a two-group ITS with an interaction term for Post × Treated. We have added a sentence to the Methods noting this equivalence *(revised Methods, Statistical Analysis)*.

---

### Comment 7 — Characterize all sensitivity analysis participants

> Although the various sensitivity analyses are helpful for demonstrating robustness, they involve inclusion of participants not characterized in Table 1… Participants who contribute data to the study should be fully characterized.

**Response:** We have added a new supplemental table (eTable 3) providing summary statistics for all additional participant groups used in sensitivity analyses: (a) the FFS Medicare placebo sample, (b) the negative control treatment groups (eFigure 6), and (c) the continuously enrolled subsample (eFigure 2) *(new Supplement, eTable 3)*.

---

### Comment 8 — "Placebo" vs. "negative control" terminology

> The methods describe alternative "placebo" groups; these sound more like negative control groups.

**Response:** We agree that "negative control" is the more precise methodological term. We have revised the Methods, Results, and supplement to use "negative control analyses" in place of "placebo tests" throughout *(revised Methods, Statistical Analysis; revised Results; revised Supplement, eMethods 3)*.

---

### Comment 9 — Report four DiD components for all figures

> The findings in figure 3 (and analogous eFigures) are difficult to interpret without knowing the four values that resulted in the difference in difference: 1) pre-2020 among control, 2) pre-2020 among ADRD, 3) 2020+ among control, and 4) 2020+ among ADRD.

**Response:** This is an excellent suggestion that substantially improves the interpretability of the results.

**[ANALYSIS NEEDED: Compute the unadjusted (raw) and covariate-adjusted means for each of the four cells (pre-2020 ADRD, pre-2020 control, post-2020 ADRD, post-2020 control) for each of the four outcome variables. Report in a new supplemental table (eTable 4) and revise Figure 3 notes to state the direction of change in each group.]**

We have added a new supplemental table (eTable 4) reporting the unadjusted means for all four cells for each outcome variable. We have also revised the notes to Figure 3 to state the direction of change in each group (pre-to-post) that gives rise to the negative interaction coefficients for access and financial burden *(new Supplement, eTable 4; revised Figure 3 notes)*. Figure 2, which plots unadjusted time trends separately for the ADRD and control groups, provides a visual representation of the pre/post means for all years, and we have added a cross-reference from Figure 3 to Figure 2 to facilitate interpretation.
